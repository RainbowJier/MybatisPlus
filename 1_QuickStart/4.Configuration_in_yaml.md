# Configuration

Most of the configurations have default values, so we don't need to configure them.
But there are some that don't have default values, such as:

1. Scan the package of aliases of entity class.
2. Global type of id.

```yaml
  mybatis-plus:
    type-aliases-package: com.itheima.mp.domain.po  # Scan the dto.
    configuration:
      map-underscore-to-camel-case: true  # map underscore
    global-config:
      db-config:
        id-type: assign_id   # Global id, if variable id don't have @TableId.
        update-strategy: not_null # Just update not null value.
```

It should be noted that MybatisPlus also supports handwritten SQL, and the read address of the mapper.xml file can be
configured by yourself.

```yaml
mybatis-plus:
  mapper-locations: "classpath*:/mapper/**/*.xml" # Mapper.xml address

```

The default value is `classpath*:/mapper/**/*.xml`, so we just need to place the mapper.xml file in `resource/mapper`
directory.

And edit the xml file:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE mapper PUBLIC "-//mybatis.org//DTD Mapper 3.0//EN" "http://mybatis.org/dtd/mybatis-3-mapper.dtd">
<mapper namespace="com.itheima.mp.mapper.UserMapper">

    <select id="queryById" resultType="User">
        SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = #{id}
    </select>

</mapper>
```
