# Logic Delete

## 1. Introduction

For some important data, we tend to use logical deletion, that is:

1. Add a filed to mark whether the data has been deleted.
2. Set the tag to true when deleting the filed.
3. Filter the data marked as true when querying.

**Example:**

1. Delete: This is not actually deleting data from the database.
    ```SQL
    UPDATE address
    SET deleted = 1
    WHERE id = 1
      AND deleted = 0;
    ```

2. Query
    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM address
    WHERE delete = 1;
    ```

## 2. Quick Start

1. address entity
    ````java
    
    @AllArgsConstructor
    @NoArgsConstructor
    @Data
    @TableName("address")
    public class Address implements Serializable {
        private Long id;
        // .....
        private String deleted;
    }
    
    ````

2. Configure file
    ```yaml
    mybatis-plus:
      global-config:
        db-config:
          logic-delete-field: deleted  # Globally Logic deletion
          logic-delete-value: 1       # Deleted value is 1
          logic-not-delete-value: 0   # Not deleted value is 0
    
    ```

3. AddressMapper
   ```java
   public interface AddressMapper extends BaseMapper<Address> {
   
   }
   ```

4. Test

```java

@SpringBootTest
public class AddressTest {
    @Autowired
    private AddressMapper addressMapper;

    @Autowired
    private IAddressService addressService;

    @Test
    void testDelete() {
        addressMapper.deleteById(59L);
    }
}
```
